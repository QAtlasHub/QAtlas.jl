# bound_registry.jl — declared BOUND edges (core/bound.jl), the inequality
# sibling of identity_registry.jl.
#
# Each names an AbstractQAtlas `@inequality` and lets the generator materialize
# it on every hub that implements the participants.  Nothing here restates the
# criterion: the slack, its sign convention, and the physics all live upstream.
#
# WHY THESE FIRST.  Of AbstractQAtlas's 129 relations, 93 are type-keyed and 22
# are reachable on some QAtlas hub — but only three of those need nothing beyond
# what `fetch` already returns.  One is `FreeEnergyLegendre`, already covered by
# the `:gibbs` identity.  The other two are these, and neither was checked
# anywhere in the atlas before.  The rest of the reachable set waits on a
# supplier for a derived input (`var_E`, `dS_dT`, the region entropies
# `S_A`/`S_AB`/…), which is the same gap identity_registry.jl's deletion
# criterion already names for the derivative-form identities.
#
# These are STABILITY bounds, and they fail differently from an equality: a
# sign error, a bad analytic continuation, or a mis-normalized thermal state
# shows up here even when two equally-wrong quantities would still satisfy an
# identity between themselves.
